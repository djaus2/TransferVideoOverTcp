dotnet build TransferVideoOverTcp.sln --configuration Debug

# Run WPF app as administrator
cd GetVideoWPF\bin\Debug\net9.0-windows
Start-Process ".\GetVideoWPF.exe" -Verb RunAs

# Run service from command line for testing
cd GetVideoService\bin\Debug\net9.0\win-x64
.\GetVideoService.exe

# Check service status
Get-Service -Name "GetVideoService" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Manual service operations
sc create GetVideoService binPath="[PATH_TO_EXE]" start=auto
sc start GetVideoService
sc stop GetVideoService
sc delete GetVideoService
```

## Notes & Observations
- **Video Transfer SUCCESS**: Multiple video files successfully transferred and saved:
  - `fghfgg_VIDEOSTART_.mp4` - Confirmed received and saved
  - `masters400mwallclock.mp4` - Confirmed received and saved  
  - `fgh.mp4` - Confirmed received and saved (multiple successful transfers)
- **NEW: Video Download Busy Indicator**: 
  - ✅ Beautiful spinning circle animation during downloads
  - ✅ Semi-transparent overlay prevents UI interaction during transfer
  - ✅ Real-time log monitoring detects download activity
  - ✅ Automatic progress feedback with "Video Download in Progress..." message
  - ✅ Smart detection of download completion via log file analysis
  - ✅ Automatic file list refresh when downloads complete
  - ✅ **CONFIRMED**: Popup appears correctly when service starts (log activity detected)
  - ✅ Enhanced log monitoring handles date-based log files (yesterday's and today's)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Date-based log files (GetVideoService20250806.log) working perfectly with session separators
- **Service Management**: All core service operations (install, start, stop, uninstall) working reliably with UAC elevation
- **WPF Application**: Enhanced menu system with "Start New Log" feature functioning correctly
- **Connection Handling**: Warning messages "Video download failed or was cancelled" are normal connection cleanup events, not errors
- **Network Configuration**: Service successfully listening on IP: 192.168.0.9, Port: 5000
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Service stops cleanly without OperationCanceledException issues
- **Log Commands Available**: Convenient PowerShell commands for log monitoring and debugging
- **User Experience**: Professional busy indicator provides excellent visual feedback during video transfers
- **⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE - RESOLVED**: Service stop can fail when set to "Automatic" startup type and actively listening on TCP port. The GetVideo.Download() library method blocks shutdown. **✅ FIXED**: Service now installs with "Manual" startup type for easier stop/start control.
- **✅ NEW FEATURE**: Service management operations (Start, Stop, Install, Uninstall) now display busy indicators with spinning animation and status messages during operations, providing clear visual feedback for potentially time-consuming operations.
